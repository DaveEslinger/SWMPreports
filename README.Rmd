# SWMPreports

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SWMPreports is to provide a convenient, consistent interface to the suite of R-scripts, MS Office documents, and other resources needed to produce the annual reserve-level SWMP Status Reports and a National Reports.

Additional reporting tools and workflows will be added as they are developed.

## Installation

You can eventually install the released version of SWMPreports from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("SWMPreports")
```

but there is no such package yet, so use the GitHub version with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("DaveEslinger/SWMPreports")

```
